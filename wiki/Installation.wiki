#summary Installing The Middler and its dependencies on Linux, OS X and Windows.

= Introduction =

This page describes how to install The Middler on each operating system, including its dependencies.

The Middler depends on the following Python modules:

  * scapy 
  * libpcap
  * readline
  * libdnet 
  * beautifulsoup

To use the plugin-metasploit.py plug-in, you'll want Metasploit.

= Linux Module Installation =

To install the necessary Python modules on Ubuntu Linux, we ran:

{{{
for package in scapy libpcap pcap python-libpcap python-readline libdnet libdnet-dev python-beautifulsoup ; do
	apt-get install $package
done
}}}

To install Metasploit, you'll need its dependencies.  Here's the command we used to install these on Ubuntu Linux:

{{{
sudo aptitude install ruby libruby rdoc libyaml-ruby libzlib-ruby libopenssl-ruby libdl-ruby libreadline-ruby libiconv-ruby rubygems
}}}

Of course, you'll want to download and install [http://www.metasploit.com Metasploit].
